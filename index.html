      <h1>ONLINE EDUCATION</h1>


      <p class="par">In the last 20 years, the Internet has grown from being nearly non-existent into the largest,<br> 
most accessible database of information ever created. It has changed the way people<br> communicate, shop, socialise, do
 business and think about knowledge and learning.<br> Much more than just a new twist on distance learning, online schooling 
is changing <br>the face of traditional classrooms and making education<br> more accessible than ever before.
 
Online education is a form of education where <br>students use their home computers through the internet.
 For many nontraditional <br>students, among them all those who want to continue working full time or raising<br>
 families, online graduations and courses have become popular in the past decade.<br> Often online graduation 
and course programmes, some of which are conducted<br> using digital technologies, are provided via the online
 learning portal<br> of the host university.<br>
Online Education Programs:-<br>
•	100% Online Education - Fully-online degrees are earned from the comfort of your own home with
 no required visits to your college or university campus.<br>
•	Hybrid Education - Hybrid education allows students to pursue a combinationof online and on-campus courses.<br>
•	Online Courses - While online courses may be part of a degree program, they can also be taken on their own 
in order to master a certain subject or learn a specific skill.<br>
•	MOOCs - MOOCs, or massive open online courses, are usually delivered in lecture form to online "classrooms"
 with as many as 10,000 people.<br>
It's not easier studying online! Online institutions must meet with the same quality requirements as brick-and-mortar
 institutions. With the advancement of online learning technologies, virtual institutions have enhanced automated processes
 to deter fraud and/or plagiarism.
Many online institutions will partner with universities on campus to develop and deliver online programs. This enables
 an online service, while providing validated course studies through the brick-and-mortar institution, to benefit from the 
advanced expertise and technology that an online provider provides.

<h4><b>Here we study about Differentiation in mathematics</b></h4>
<p class="par">What is Differentiation?<br>
Differentiation is the essence of Calculus. A derivative is defined as the instantaneous rate of change in function based on one of its variables. It is similar to finding the slope of a tangent to the function at a point.
Suppose you need to find the slope of the tangent line to a graph at point P. The slope can be approximated by drawing a line through point P and finding the slope by a line that is known as the secant line.
A function f in x is said to be differentiable at the point x = a, if the derivative f'(a) exists at every point in its domain. The derivative of a function f(x) is given by:

<p class="par">
For a function to be differentiable at any point x = a, in its domain, it must be continuous at that particular point but vice-versa is necessarily not always true. The domain of f’(x) is defined by the existence of its limits.
If y = f(x) is a function in x, then the derivative of f(x) is given as dy/dx. This is known as the derivative of y with respect to x.

<p class="par">Nouns:- <br>
Main article: English nouns
Many common suffixes form nouns from other nouns or from other types of words,<br> such as -age (as in shrinkage), -hood (as in sisterhood), and so on,[3] although many nouns are base forms not containing any such suffix (such as cat, grass, France). Nouns are also often created by conversion of verbs or adjectives, as with the words talk and reading (a boring talk, the assigned reading).
Nouns are sometimes classified semantically (by their meanings) as proper nouns and common nouns (Cyrus, China vs. frog, milk) or as concrete nouns and abstract nouns (book, laptop vs. embarrassment, prejudice).[4] A grammatical distinction is often made between count (countable) nouns such as clock and city, and non-count (uncountable) nouns such as milk and decor.[5] Some nouns can function both as countable and as uncountable such as the word "wine" (This is a good wine, I prefer red wine).
Countable nouns generally have singular and plural forms.[4] In most cases the plural is formed from the singular by adding -[e]s (as in dogs, bushes), although there are also irregular forms (woman/women, foot/feet, etc.), including cases where the two forms are identical (sheep, series). For more details, see English plural. Certain nouns can be used with plural verbs even though they are singular in form, as in The government were ... (where the government is considered to refer to the people constituting the government). This is a form of synesis; it is more common in British than American English. See English plural § Singulars with collective meaning treated as plural.
English nouns are not marked for case as they are in some languages, but they have possessive forms, through the addition of -'s (as in John's, children's) or just an apostrophe (with no change in pronunciation) in the case of -[e]s plurals and sometimes other words ending with -s (the dogs' owners, Jesus' love). More generally, the ending can be applied to noun phrases (as in the man you saw yesterday's sister); see below. The possessive form can be used either as a determiner (John's cat) or as a noun phrase (John's is the one next to Jane's).
The status of the possessive as an affix or a clitic is the subject of debate.[6][7] It differs from the noun inflection of languages such as German, in that the genitive ending may attach to the last word of the phrase. To account for this, the possessive can be analysed, for instance as a clitic construction (an "enclitic postposition"[8]) or as an inflection[9][10] of the last word of a phrase ("edge inflection").
Phrases
Noun phrases are phrases that function grammatically as nouns within sentences, for example as the subject or object of a verb. Most noun phrases have a noun as their head.[5]
An English noun phrase typically takes the following form (not all elements need be present):

<h4>Bernauli Theorem:- </h4>
<p class="par">Bernoulli’s theorem, in fluid dynamics, relation among the pressure, velocity, and elevation in a moving fluid (liquid or gas), the compressibility and viscosity (internal friction) of which are negligible and the flow of which is steady, or laminar. First derived (1738) by the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli, the theorem states, in effect, that the total mechanical energy of the flowing fluid, comprising the energy associated with fluid pressure, the gravitational potential energy of elevation, and the kinetic energy of fluid motion, remains constant. Bernoulli’s theorem is the principle of energy conservation for ideal fluids in steady, or streamline, flow and is the basis for many engineering applications.

<p class="par">Bernoulli’s theorem implies, therefore, that if the fluid flows horizontally so that no change in gravitational potential energy occurs, then a decrease in fluid pressure is associated with an increase in fluid velocity. If the fluid is flowing through a horizontal pipe of varying cross-sectional area, for example, the fluid speeds up in constricted areas so that the pressure the fluid exerts is least where the cross section is smallest. This phenomenon is sometimes called the Venturi effect, after the Italian scientist G.B. Venturi (1746–1822), who first noted the effects of constricted channels on fluid flow.
